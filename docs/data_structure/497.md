## Description

Given a list of non-overlapping axis-aligned rectangles rects, write a function pick which randomly and uniformily picks an integer point in the space covered by the rectangles.

Note:

An integer point is a point that has integer coordinates. 
A point on the perimeter of a rectangle is included in the space covered by the rectangles. 
ith rectangle = rects[i] = [x1,y1,x2,y2], where [x1, y1] are the integer coordinates of the bottom-left corner, and [x2, y2] are the integer coordinates of the top-right corner.
length and width of each rectangle does not exceed 2000.
1 <= rects.length <= 100
pick return a point as an array of integer coordinates [p_x, p_y]
pick is called at most 10000 times.
Example 1:

Input: 
["Solution","pick","pick","pick"]
[[[[1,1,5,5]]],[],[],[]]
Output: 
[null,[4,1],[4,1],[3,3]]
Example 2:

Input: 
["Solution","pick","pick","pick","pick","pick"]
[[[[-2,-2,-1,-1],[1,0,3,0]]],[],[],[],[],[]]
Output: 
[null,[-1,-2],[2,0],[-2,-1],[3,0],[-2,-2]]
Explanation of Input Syntax:

The input is two lists: the subroutines called and their arguments. Solution's constructor has one argument, the array of rectangles rects. pick has no arguments. Arguments are always wrapped with a list, even if there aren't any.

## Solution

```c++
class Solution {
    int total;
    vector<vector<int>> rect;
    vector<int> areas; // prefix sum for rectangle areas, increasing monotone
public:
    Solution(vector<vector<int>>& rects) {
        rect = rects;
        total = 0;
        for(auto r : rects){
            total += (r[2]-r[0]+1)*(r[3]-r[1]+1);
            areas.push_back(total); // it's like prefix sum
        }
    }
    
    vector<int> pick() {
        // 1. randomly pick rectangle i
        int random_area = rand()%total;
        int i = 0; // pick rectangle
        for(; i < areas.size(); i++){
            if(areas[i] > random_area){
                break;
            }
        }
        // 2. randomly pick coordinate x,y inside rect[i]
        int x = rand()%(rect[i][2]-rect[i][0]+1) + rect[i][0];
        int y = rand()%(rect[i][3]-rect[i][1]+1) + rect[i][1];
        return {x,y};
    }
};

/**
 * Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * Solution* obj = new Solution(rects);
 * vector<int> param_1 = obj->pick();
 */
