# 1091. Shortest Path in Binary Matrix

[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-in-binary-matrix/)

**difficulty(1-5)**
3

**notes**   


## Description

In an N by N square grid, each cell is either empty (0) or blocked (1).

A clear path from top-left to bottom-right has length k if and only if it is composed of cells C_1, C_2, ..., C_k such that:

Adjacent cells C_i and C_{i+1} are connected 8-directionally (ie., they are different and share an edge or corner)
C_1 is at location (0, 0) (ie. has value grid[0][0])
C_k is at location (N-1, N-1) (ie. has value grid[N-1][N-1])
If C_i is located at (r, c), then grid[r][c] is empty (ie. grid[r][c] == 0).
Return the length of the shortest such clear path from top-left to bottom-right.  If such a path does not exist, return -1.

 

Example 1:

Input: [[0,1],[1,0]]


Output: 2

Example 2:

Input: [[0,0,0],[1,1,0],[1,1,0]]


Output: 4

 

Note:

1 <= grid.length == grid[0].length <= 100
grid[r][c] is 0 or 1

## Solution

```c++
class Solution {
    vector<vector<int>> dir = { {0,1}, {0,-1}, {-1,0}, {1,0}, {1,1}, {-1,-1}, {1,-1}, {-1,1} };
public:
    int shortestPathBinaryMatrix(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int res = 1;
        int n = grid.size();
        if (n == 0 || grid[0][0] == 1 || grid[n-1][n-1] == 1){
            return -1;
        }
        if (n == 1){
            return 1;
        }
        queue<pair<int,int>> q;
        q.push({0,0});
        while (!q.empty()){
            int size = q.size();
            res++;
            for(int i = 0; i < size; i ++){
                auto cur = q.front(); q.pop();
                for(auto d : dir){
                    int x = cur.first + d[0];
                    int y = cur.second + d[1];
                    if ((x == (n-1)) && (y == (n-1))){
                        return res;
                    }
                    if (x < 0 || y < 0 || x >= n || y >= n || grid[x][y] == 1){
                        continue;
                    }
                    q.push({x,y});
                    grid[x][y] = 1;
                }
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
