# 275. H-Index II

## Description

Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

Example:

Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
Output: 3 
Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
             received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively. 
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
Note:

If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

Follow up:

This is a follow up problem to H-Index, where citations is now guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
Could you solve it in logarithmic time complexity?


## Solution

binary serach by result h, h is within [0,n]

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int hIndex(vector<int>& citations) {
        int n = citations.size();
        if(n == 0){
            return 0;
        }
        // binary search by result
        int s = 0, e = n; 
        while(s + 1 < e) {
            int mid = s + (e - s)/2;
            if(citations[n-mid] >= mid){
                s = mid;
            }
            else{
                e = mid;
            }
        }
        if(citations[n-e] >= e){
            return e;
        }
        return s;
    }
};
```
