## Description

Given string S and a dictionary of words words, find the number of words[i] that is a subsequence of S.

Example :
Input: 
S = "abcde"
words = ["a", "bb", "acd", "ace"]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three words in words that are a subsequence of S: "a", "acd", "ace".
Note:

All words in words and S will only consists of lowercase letters.
The length of S will be in the range of [1, 50000].
The length of words will be in the range of [1, 5000].
The length of words[i] will be in the range of [1, 50].

## Solution

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int numMatchingSubseq(string S, vector<string>& words) {
        /* search in parallel. Use unordered_map<char,vector<pair<int,int>>> expect
        to save each time who (words index and character index) is expecting which character.
        for every char in S, fulfill those expect[c] and update them to their next expecting
        char.
        */
        int n = words.size();
        int res = 0;
        unordered_map<char,vector<pair<int,int>>> expect; // char - words index & pos that expect char.
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            expect[words[i][0]].push_back({i,0});
        }
        for (auto c : S){
            auto tmp = expect[c];
            expect[c].clear();
            for (auto p : tmp){
                p.second++;
                if (p.second == (words[p.first]).size()){
                    res++;
                }
                else{
                    expect[words[p.first][p.second]].push_back({p.first, p.second});
                }
            }
        }
        return res;        
    }
};
```
