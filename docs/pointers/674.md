# 674. Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence

[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-continuous-increasing-subsequence/)

**difficulty(1-5)**
2

**notes**


## Description

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest continuous increasing subsequence (subarray).

Example 1:
Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5], its length is 3. 
Even though [1,3,5,7] is also an increasing subsequence, it's not a continuous one where 5 and 7 are separated by 4. 
Example 2:
Input: [2,2,2,2,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2], its length is 1. 
Note: Length of the array will not exceed 10,000.

## Solution

Note:

set aside nums.size() == 0 situation, then the res is at least 1, and len is also
at least 1!

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int findLengthOfLCIS(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.size() == 0){
            return 0;
        }
        int res = 1;
        int len = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); i++){
            if (nums[i] > nums[i-1]) {
                len++;
            }
            else {
                len = 1;
            }
            res = max(res, len);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
