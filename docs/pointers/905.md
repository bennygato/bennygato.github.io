# 905. Sort Array By Parity

[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-array-by-parity/solution/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
1

**notes**
注意特殊情况，比如 `[0,2]`

## Description

Given an array A of non-negative integers, return an array consisting of all the even elements of A, followed by all the odd elements of A.
You may return any answer array that satisfies this condition.
Example 1:
Input: [3,1,2,4]
Output: [2,4,3,1]
The outputs [4,2,3,1], [2,4,1,3], and [4,2,1,3] would also be accepted.
Note:
1 <= A.length <= 5000
0 <= A[i] <= 5000

## Solution

Note that during while loop `i < j` needs to be always satisfied!

```c++
/*
in place, O(n) time. O(1) extra space.
*/
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> sortArrayByParity(vector<int>& A) {
        int n = A.size();
        vector<int> res(A);
        if (n == 0) {
            return res;
        }
        int i = 0;
        int j = n-1;
        while (i < j) {
            while (i < j && res[i]%2 == 0) {
                i++;
            }
            while (i < j && res[j]%2 == 1) {
                j--;
            }
            if (i < j) {
                iter_swap(res.begin()+i, res.begin()+j);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
