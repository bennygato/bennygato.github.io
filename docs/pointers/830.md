# 830. Positions of Large Groups

[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/positions-of-large-groups/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
3

**notes**   


## Description

In a string S of lowercase letters, these letters form consecutive groups of the same character.

For example, a string like S = "abbxxxxzyy" has the groups "a", "bb", "xxxx", "z" and "yy".

Call a group large if it has 3 or more characters.  We would like the starting and ending positions of every large group.

The final answer should be in lexicographic order.

 

Example 1:

Input: "abbxxxxzzy"
Output: [[3,6]]
Explanation: "xxxx" is the single large group with starting  3 and ending positions 6.
Example 2:

Input: "abc"
Output: []
Explanation: We have "a","b" and "c" but no large group.
Example 3:

Input: "abcdddeeeeaabbbcd"
Output: [[3,5],[6,9],[12,14]]

## Solution

don't forget last one!!!

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> largeGroupPositions(string S) {
        vector<vector<int>> res;
        int start = 0;
        int len = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < S.length(); i++){
            if (S[i] == S[i-1]){
                len++;
            }
            else {
                if (len >= 3){
                    res.push_back({start,i-1});
                }
                start = i;
                len = 1;
            }
        }
        //!!!!! don't forget the last one!!!!!
        if (len >= 3){
            res.push_back({start, S.length()-1});
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
