## Description
In a list of songs, the i-th song has a duration of time[i] seconds. 

Return the number of pairs of songs for which their total duration in seconds is divisible by 60.  Formally, we want the number of indices i < j with (time[i] + time[j]) % 60 == 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: [30,20,150,100,40]
Output: 3
Explanation: Three pairs have a total duration divisible by 60:
(time[0] = 30, time[2] = 150): total duration 180
(time[1] = 20, time[3] = 100): total duration 120
(time[1] = 20, time[4] = 40): total duration 60
Example 2:

Input: [60,60,60]
Output: 3
Explanation: All three pairs have a total duration of 120, which is divisible by 60.
 

Note:

1 <= time.length <= 60000
1 <= time[i] <= 500

## Solution
好难啊好难啊好难啊.
把所有数字%60 以后统计cnts, cnts属于[0,59]. 

其中0, 30 是特殊情况. 如果0的个数有n个,那么把n中随便选两个都可以. 同理30. C n 2 = (n-1)*n/2

剩下的就简单了..

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int numPairsDivisibleBy60(vector<int>& time) {
        vector<int> cnts(60,0); // [0,59]
        for (auto t: time){
             cnts[t%60]++;
        }
        int res = cnts[0]*(cnts[0]-1)/2 + cnts[30]*(cnts[30]-1)/2;
        for (int i = 1; i <= 29; i++){
            res += cnts[i] * cnts[60-i];
        }
        return res;        
    }
};
```
