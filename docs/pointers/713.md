# 713. Subarray Product Less Than K

## Description

Your are given an array of positive integers nums.

Count and print the number of (contiguous) subarrays where the product of all the elements in the subarray is less than k.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [10, 5, 2, 6], k = 100
Output: 8
Explanation: The 8 subarrays that have product less than 100 are: [10], [5], [2], [6], [10, 5], [5, 2], [2, 6], [5, 2, 6].
Note that [10, 5, 2] is not included as the product of 100 is not strictly less than k.
Note:

0 < nums.length <= 50000.
0 < nums[i] < 1000.
0 <= k < 10^6.

## Solution

numbers are all positive. so *product* increase monotonously.

1. about i
`i` is the left most place to make product of i to j to qualify (< k).
if product of i to j is >k, then i++. Constraint is i at most become j+1, so that j-i+1 = 0 in that case.
if i == j, then res += j-i+1 => res += 1

2. about res
consider i is fixed, and i~j still qualify. 
compare to i~j-1 situation, the subarray counts increases by the len of i to j, which is j-i+1

every time j move forward by 1, we get

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int numSubarrayProductLessThanK(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int res = 0;
        int i = 0;
        long long prod = 1;
        for(int j = 0; j < nums.size(); j++){
            prod *= nums[j];
            while(i <= j && prod >= k){
                prod /= nums[i++];
            }
            res += (j-i+1);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
