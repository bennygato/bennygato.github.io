# 1004. Max Consecutive Ones III
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones-iii/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
5

**notes**   


## Description
Given an array A of 0s and 1s, we may change up to K values from 0 to 1.

Return the length of the longest (contiguous) subarray that contains only 1s. 

 

Example 1:

Input: A = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], K = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: 
[1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.
Example 2:

Input: A = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], K = 3
Output: 10
Explanation: 
[0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.
 

Note:

1 <= A.length <= 20000
0 <= K <= A.length
A[i] is 0 or 1 

## Solution 1
My own solution, apparently after understanding this question is asking for 'longest subarray that has maximum of K zeroes'.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int longestOnes(vector<int>& A, int K) {
        // find longest subarray that has maximum of K 0s. 
        int n = A.size();
        int res = 0;
        for (int l = -1, r = -1; r+1 < n; ){
            r++;
            if (A[r] == 0){
                K--;
                if (K < 0){
                    l++;
                    while(l < 0 || A[l] == 1){
                        l++;
                    }
                    K++;                    
                }
            }
            res = max(res, r - l);
        }        
        return res;
    }
};
```
