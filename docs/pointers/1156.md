## Description
Given a string text, we are allowed to swap two of the characters in the string. Find the length of the longest substring with repeated characters.

 

Example 1:

Input: text = "ababa"
Output: 3
Explanation: We can swap the first 'b' with the last 'a', or the last 'b' with the first 'a'. Then, the longest repeated character substring is "aaa", which its length is 3.
Example 2:

Input: text = "aaabaaa"
Output: 6
Explanation: Swap 'b' with the last 'a' (or the first 'a'), and we get longest repeated character substring "aaaaaa", which its length is 6.
Example 3:

Input: text = "aaabbaaa"
Output: 4
Example 4:

Input: text = "aaaaa"
Output: 5
Explanation: No need to swap, longest repeated character substring is "aaaaa", length is 5.
Example 5:

Input: text = "abcdef"
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

1 <= text.length <= 20000
text consist of lowercase English characters only.

## Solution
Approach 1: Sliding Window
For each character ch within a..z, use the sliding window to detect the longest substring (with up to one different character).

Note that the result will be the minimum of the longest substring and the total number of characters ch, since we may not have an extra character to swap and close the gap.

学习写法。。。 longest substring (with up to 1 different character) 特别神奇！！！

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxRepOpt1(string text) {
        int n = text.length();
        int res = 0;
        for (char c = 'a'; c <= 'z'; c++){
            int i = 0, j = 0, gap = 0, cnt = 0;
            // i ~ j : j-i is the longest repeated char substring with maximum of 1 gap allowed (counted in already)
            while (j < n){
                cnt += (text[j] == c);
                gap += (text[j] != c);
                j++;
                if (gap > 1){ // allow gap = 1
                    gap -= (text[i] != c);
                    i++;
                }
            }
            res = max(res, min(j-i, cnt));
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
