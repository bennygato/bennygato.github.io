# 881. Boats to Save People

[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/boats-to-save-people/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
3

**notes**   


## Description

The i-th person has weight people[i], and each boat can carry a maximum weight of limit.

Each boat carries at most 2 people at the same time, provided the sum of the weight of those people is at most limit.

Return the minimum number of boats to carry every given person.  (It is guaranteed each person can be carried by a boat.)

{%raw%}
Example 1:

Input: people = [1,2], limit = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 boat (1, 2)
Example 2:

Input: people = [3,2,2,1], limit = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 boats (1, 2), (2) and (3)
Example 3:

Input: people = [3,5,3,4], limit = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: 4 boats (3), (3), (4), (5)
Note:

1 <= people.length <= 50000
1 <= people[i] <= limit <= 30000
{%endraw%}

## Solution

sort array.
Let heaviest people go onto boat first, if we can add a light one, add it, otherwise, ship the boat and bring another one

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int numRescueBoats(vector<int>& people, int limit) {
        int res = 0;
        sort(people.begin(), people.end());
        int n = people.size();
        int l = 0, r = n-1;
        while (l <= r){
            if (l < r && (people[l] + people[r]) <= limit){
                l++;
            }
            r--;
            res++;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
