# 605. Can Place Flowers

[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/can-place-flowers/)

**difficulty(1-5)**

**notes**
自己没想出来。。。

## Description

Suppose you have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots - they would compete for water and both would die.

Given a flowerbed (represented as an array containing 0 and 1, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty), and a number n, return if n new flowers can be planted in it without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.

```
Example 1:
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: True
Example 2:
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: False
```

Note:
The input array won't violate no-adjacent-flowers rule.
The input array size is in the range of [1, 20000].
n is a non-negative integer which won't exceed the input array size.

## Solution

其实很简单啊T.T

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool canPlaceFlowers(vector<int>& flowerbed, int n) {
        flowerbed.push_back(0);
        flowerbed.insert(flowerbed.begin(),0);
        for (int i = 1; i < flowerbed.size()-1; i++){
            if ((flowerbed[i-1] + flowerbed[i] + flowerbed[i+1]) == 0){
                // i-1, i, i+1 all 0s. then plant here. 
                i++; // since cur i pos is taken, i++ position is out of consideration!
                n--;
            }
        }
        return n <= 0;
    }
};
```
