so hard...... learn!!!

## Description
Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the maximum sum of a non-empty subsequence of that array such that for every two consecutive integers in the subsequence, nums[i] and nums[j], where i < j, the condition j - i <= k is satisfied.

A subsequence of an array is obtained by deleting some number of elements (can be zero) from the array, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [10,2,-10,5,20], k = 2
Output: 37
Explanation: The subsequence is [10, 2, 5, 20].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,-2,-3], k = 1
Output: -1
Explanation: The subsequence must be non-empty, so we choose the largest number.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [10,-2,-10,-5,20], k = 2
Output: 23
Explanation: The subsequence is [10, -2, -5, 20].
 

Constraints:

1 <= k <= nums.length <= 10^5
-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4

## Solution
dp[i]: max sum that must use nums[i] as end
dp[i] = max(0, dp[i-1], dp[i-2]...dp[i-k]) + nums[i]

how to get the max(....)? use deque! 
deque saves the descending number of dp[i-1], dp[i-2].. dp[i-k] (deque's size migth be smaller than this, if the number is not qualified, such as <0 then no need to add to deque)

see [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/constrained-subsequence-sum/discuss/597751/JavaC%2B%2BPython-O(N)-Decreasing-Deque) for more explanation:

```python
class Solution:
    def constrainedSubsetSum(self, A: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        """
        Transition: A[i] = max(0, A[i - k], A[i - k + 1], .., A[i - 1]) + A[i]. (@lee215 modifies the input A directly)            
        Translated into a traditional dp: dp[i] = max(0, dp[i - k], dp[i - k + 1], .., dp[i -1]) + A[i]
        dp[i] is the max sum we can have from A[:i] when A[i] has been chosen.
        """ 
        # `deque` stores dp[i - k], dp[i-k+1], .., dp[i - 1] whose values are larger than 0 in a decreasing order
        # Note that the length of `deque` is not necessarily `k`. The values smaller than dp[i-1] will be discarded. If u r confused, go on and come back later. 
        deque = collections.deque() 
        for i in xrange(len(A)):
            # deque[0] is the max of (0, dp[i - k], dp[i-k+1], .., dp[i - 1])
            A[i] += deque[0] if deque else 0 
            # 1. We always want to retrieve the max of (0, dp[i - k], dp[i-k+1], .., dp[i - 1]) from `deque`
            # 2. We expect dp[i] to be added to `deque` so that we can compute dp[i + 1] in the next iteration
            # 3. So, if dp[i] is larger than some old values, we can discard them safely.
            # 4. As a result, the length of `deque` is not necessarily `k`
            while len(deque) and A[i] >= deque[-1]:
                deque.pop()
            # no need to store the negative value
            if A[i] > 0:
                deque.append(A[i])
            # we do not need the value of A[i - k] when computing dp[i+1] in the next iteration, because `j - i <= k` has to be satisfied.
            if i >= k and deque and deque[0] == A[i - k]:
                deque.popleft()
        return max(A)
```

```c++

        vector<int> dp(nums); // dp[i] = max sum that must use nums[i] as end

        int res = -1;
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++){
