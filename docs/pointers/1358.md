## Description
Given a string s consisting only of characters a, b and c.

Return the number of substrings containing at least one occurrence of all these characters a, b and c.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabc"
Output: 10
Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b and c are "abc", "abca", "abcab", "abcabc", "bca", "bcab", "bcabc", "cab", "cabc" and "abc" (again). 
Example 2:

Input: s = "aaacb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b and c are "aaacb", "aacb" and "acb". 
Example 3:

Input: s = "abc"
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

3 <= s.length <= 5 x 10^4
s only consists of a, b or c characters.

## Solution
why `res += i;`?

0,1,...i....j

substry [i~j] has exactly 1 occurance of all a b c. So for subarray [0~j], [1~j],
[2~j]....[i~j] are all qualified. 
(note that by the time i exit from while loop it overshooted so we don't need to do 
res += i+1)

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfSubstrings(string s) {
        int res = 0;
        int i = 0;
        int n = s.length();
        vector<int> cnt = {0,0,0}; // cnt for a,b,c
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++){
            cnt[s[j]-'a']++;
            while(cnt[0] && cnt[1] && cnt[2]){
                // now cnt[] found all a,b,c, move i forward while still satisfying a,b,c
                // so that [k~j] has a,b,c, while k is [0,i]
                // note that i++ at last so it's 'overshoot' by 1, when calculating res, instead of res += (i-0+1), we use
                // res += i.
                cnt[s[i]-'a']--;
                i++;
            }
            res += i;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
