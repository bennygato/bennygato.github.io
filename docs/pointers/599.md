# 599. Minimum Index Sum of Two Lists

**difficulty(1-5)**

## Description
Suppose Andy and Doris want to choose a restaurant for dinner, and they both have a list of favorite restaurants represented by strings.

You need to help them find out their common interest with the least list index sum. If there is a choice tie between answers, output all of them with no order requirement. You could assume there always exists an answer.
```
Example 1:
Input:
["Shogun", "Tapioca Express", "Burger King", "KFC"]
["Piatti", "The Grill at Torrey Pines", "Hungry Hunter Steakhouse", "Shogun"]
Output: ["Shogun"]
Explanation: The only restaurant they both like is "Shogun".
Example 2:
Input:
["Shogun", "Tapioca Express", "Burger King", "KFC"]
["KFC", "Shogun", "Burger King"]
Output: ["Shogun"]
Explanation: The restaurant they both like and have the least index sum is "Shogun" with index sum 1 (0+1).
```
Note:
The length of both lists will be in the range of [1, 1000].
The length of strings in both lists will be in the range of [1, 30].
The index is starting from 0 to the list length minus 1.
No duplicates in both lists.

## Solution
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> findRestaurant(vector<string>& list1, vector<string>& list2) {
        unordered_map<string,int> m1; // list 1 item - index
        for (int i = 0; i < list1.size(); i++){
            m1[list1[i]] = i;
        }
        int sum = INT_MAX;
        vector<string> res;
        for (int i =0; i < list2.size(); i++){
            if (!m1.count(list2[i])) {
                continue;
            }
            if (sum > (i + m1[list2[i]])) {
                //!!!!!! CLEAR PREVIOUS RES!!
                res.clear(); 
            }
            if (sum >= (i + m1[list2[i]])) {
                sum = i + m1[list2[i]];
                res.push_back(list2[i]);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
