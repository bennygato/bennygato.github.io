## Description
Given a string s, return the maximum number of ocurrences of any substring under the following rules:

The number of unique characters in the substring must be less than or equal to maxLetters.
The substring size must be between minSize and maxSize inclusive.
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "aababcaab", maxLetters = 2, minSize = 3, maxSize = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: Substring "aab" has 2 ocurrences in the original string.
It satisfies the conditions, 2 unique letters and size 3 (between minSize and maxSize).
Example 2:

Input: s = "aaaa", maxLetters = 1, minSize = 3, maxSize = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: Substring "aaa" occur 2 times in the string. It can overlap.
Example 3:

Input: s = "aabcabcab", maxLetters = 2, minSize = 2, maxSize = 3
Output: 3
Example 4:

Input: s = "abcde", maxLetters = 2, minSize = 3, maxSize = 3
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 10^5
1 <= maxLetters <= 26
1 <= minSize <= maxSize <= min(26, s.length)
s only contains lowercase English letters.

## Solution
tricky part - the maxSize is not needed at all. 
with same 'prefix' whose length is minSize, adding additional stuff to reach
maxSize is a waste and will reduce the occurences of this longer substring. 
Thus, only minSize is needed. this becomes sliding window while keeping number of
unique characters within maxLetters problem.

```c++
/* because we only need max number of occurences of substring, so although substring
len can be [minSize~maxSize], it's always better to keep len = minSize!
Thus, we can check substring with len = minSize ONLY. 
This way, counting number of unique characters becomes easier since the moving window 
size = len = minSize all the time. 
*/
class Solution {
public:
    int maxFreq(string s, int maxLetters, int minSize, int maxSize) {
        unordered_map<string,int> m; // qualified string - freq
        int res = 0;
        int len = minSize;
        unordered_map<char,int> cnt; // char - cnt
        for (int i = 0; (len+i) <= s.length(); i++){
            if (i == 0){
                for (int k = 0; k < len; k++){
                    cnt[s[k]]++;
                }
            }
            else{
                cnt[s[i-1]]--;
                if (cnt[s[i-1]] == 0){
                    cnt.erase(s[i-1]);
                }
                cnt[s[i+len-1]]++;
            }
            if (cnt.size() <= maxLetters){
                string sub = s.substr(i, len);
                m[sub]++;
                res = max(res, m[sub]);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
