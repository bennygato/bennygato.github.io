# 855. Exam Room

[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/exam-room/)

**difficulty(1-5)**

**notes**   


## Description

In an exam room, there are N seats in a single row, numbered 0, 1, 2, ..., N-1.

When a student enters the room, they must sit in the seat that maximizes the distance to the closest person.  If there are multiple such seats, they sit in the seat with the lowest number.  (Also, if no one is in the room, then the student sits at seat number 0.)

Return a class ExamRoom(int N) that exposes two functions: ExamRoom.seat() returning an int representing what seat the student sat in, and ExamRoom.leave(int p) representing that the student in seat number p now leaves the room.  It is guaranteed that any calls to ExamRoom.leave(p) have a student sitting in seat p.

 

Example 1:

Input: ["ExamRoom","seat","seat","seat","seat","leave","seat"], [[10],[],[],[],[],[4],[]]
Output: [null,0,9,4,2,null,5]
Explanation:
ExamRoom(10) -> null
seat() -> 0, no one is in the room, then the student sits at seat number 0.
seat() -> 9, the student sits at the last seat number 9.
seat() -> 4, the student sits at the last seat number 4.
seat() -> 2, the student sits at the last seat number 2.
leave(4) -> null
seat() -> 5, the student sits at the last seat number 5.
​​​​​​​

Note:

1 <= N <= 10^9
ExamRoom.seat() and ExamRoom.leave() will be called at most 10^4 times across all test cases.
Calls to ExamRoom.leave(p) are guaranteed to have a student currently sitting in seat number p.

## Solution
This looks similar to [849. Maximize Distance to Closest Person](/docs/849) but if I use the same method, I get TLE. 

So this solution is not creating arr with lengths of seat, it ONLY saves index that has person!

```c++
class ExamRoom {
private:
    vector<int> arr; // only record seated positions
    int n;
public:
    ExamRoom(int N) {
        n = N;
    }
    
    int seat() {
        if (arr.size() == 0){
            arr.push_back(0);
            return 0;
        }
        // d is longest distance found, either at beginning, or end, of middle
        int d = max(arr[0], n-1-arr.back());
        for (int i = 1; i < arr.size(); i++){
            d = max(d, (arr[i]-arr[i-1])/2);
        }
        
        if (d == arr[0]){
            arr.insert(arr.begin(), 0);
            return 0;
        }
        for (int i = 1; i < arr.size(); i++){
            if (d == (arr[i]-arr[i-1])/2){
                arr.insert(arr.begin()+i, (arr[i]+arr[i-1])/2); /* insert BEFORE index i */
                return arr[i]; /* index of the new insert IS i!!!! */
            }
        }
        // put this at last because "If there are multiple such seats, they sit in the seat with the lowest number."
        // if (d == (n-1-arr.back())){
        arr.push_back(n-1);
        return n-1;
    }

    void leave(int p) {
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++){
            if (arr[i] == p){
                arr.erase(arr.begin()+i);
            }
        }
    }
};

 * int param_1 = obj->seat();
