## Description
Given a binary array data, return the minimum number of swaps required to group all 1â€™s present in the array together in any place in the array.

 

Example 1:

Input: [1,0,1,0,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
There are 3 ways to group all 1's together:
[1,1,1,0,0] using 1 swap.
[0,1,1,1,0] using 2 swaps.
[0,0,1,1,1] using 1 swap.
The minimum is 1.
Example 2:

Input: [0,0,0,1,0]
Output: 0
Explanation: 
Since there is only one 1 in the array, no swaps needed.
Example 3:

Input: [1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
One possible solution that uses 3 swaps is [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1].
 

Note:

1 <= data.length <= 10^5
0 <= data[i] <= 1

## Solution
```c++
/* Eventually we want a window (size is `len`) full of 1s. window len = number of 1s.
Then it become a moving window problem that find a window with most 1s, the minimum movement is (total 1s - len)
*/
class Solution {
public:
    int minSwaps(vector<int>& data) {
        int len = 0; // sliding window size = number of 1s
        for (auto n : data){
            if (n == 1){
                len++;
            }
        }
        
        int cur = 0;
        int max_cnt = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < data.size(); i++){
            if (i < len){
                cur += (data[i] == 1) ? 1 : 0;
            }
            else{
                max_cnt = max(max_cnt, cur);
                cur = cur - data[i-len] + data[i];
            }
        }
        max_cnt = max(max_cnt, cur);
        return len - max_cnt;
    }
};
```
