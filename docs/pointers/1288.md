## Description
Given a list of intervals, remove all intervals that are covered by another interval in the list. Interval [a,b) is covered by interval [c,d) if and only if c <= a and b <= d.

After doing so, return the number of remaining intervals.

 

Example 1:

Input: intervals = [[1,4],[3,6],[2,8]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Interval [3,6] is covered by [2,8], therefore it is removed.
 

Constraints:

1 <= intervals.length <= 1000
0 <= intervals[i][0] < intervals[i][1] <= 10^5
intervals[i] != intervals[j] for all i != j

## Solution
```   
      l         r
A     |---------|
B1    |--------------|  l: don't update, r: update
B2      |-----|         l: don't update, r: don't update
B3      |------------|  l: update, r: update. !!worry about C covered by A but cannot covered by B [l,r]? draw it!
C1        |----|        if C can be covered by A, then it must can be covered by B, because C's left bound >= B's left bound >= A's left bound.
```
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int removeCoveredIntervals(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
        sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end());
        int res = 0;
        int l = -1, r = -1;
        for (auto& v: intervals){
            if (v[0] > l && v[1] > r){
                res++;
                l = v[0];
            }
            r = max(r, v[1]);            
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
