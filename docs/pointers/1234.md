# 1234. Replace the Substring for Balanced String
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/replace-the-substring-for-balanced-string/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
5

**notes**   
sliding window. very hard.

## Description
You are given a string containing only 4 kinds of characters 'Q', 'W', 'E' and 'R'.

A string is said to be balanced if each of its characters appears n/4 times where n is the length of the string.

Return the minimum length of the substring that can be replaced with any other string of the same length to make the original string s balanced.

Return 0 if the string is already balanced.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "QWER"
Output: 0
Explanation: s is already balanced.
Example 2:

Input: s = "QQWE"
Output: 1
Explanation: We need to replace a 'Q' to 'R', so that "RQWE" (or "QRWE") is balanced.
Example 3:

Input: s = "QQQW"
Output: 2
Explanation: We can replace the first "QQ" to "ER". 
Example 4:

Input: s = "QQQQ"
Output: 3
Explanation: We can replace the last 3 'Q' to make s = "QWER".
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 10^5
s.length is a multiple of 4
s contains only 'Q', 'W', 'E' and 'R'.

## Solution
sliding window. 

Keep track of the counts OUTSIDE of the window. 
One important thing is in while loop, here we use `i<n`, we can 
also use `i <= (j+1)`. 
But we cannot use something like `i <= j`. It'll return res = 1 for 
simplest case:
"QWER".
because when calculating distance j-i+1 if i==j min distance will be 1, which is wrong.
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int balancedString(string s) {
        unordered_map<char,int> cnt; 
        for (auto c : s){
            cnt[c]++;
        }
        int i = 0;
        int n = s.length();
        int res = INT_MAX;
        /* cnt keeps track of cnts OUTSIDE of [i,j] window. 
        As long as max(cnt[c]) <= n/4, outside
        is good and only inside needs to be replaced!
        */
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++){
            cnt[s[j]]--;
            while(i < n && max({cnt['Q'], cnt['W'], cnt['E'], cnt['R']}) <= n/4){
                cnt[s[i]]++;
                res = min(res, j-i+1);
                i++;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};

```
