# 922. Sort Array By Parity II

[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-array-by-parity-ii/)

**difficulty(1-5)**

**notes**

## Description

Given an array A of non-negative integers, half of the integers in A are odd, and half of the integers are even.

Sort the array so that whenever A[i] is odd, i is odd; and whenever A[i] is even, i is even.

You may return any answer array that satisfies this condition.

Example 1:

Input: [4,2,5,7]
Output: [4,5,2,7]
Explanation: [4,7,2,5], [2,5,4,7], [2,7,4,5] would also have been accepted.
 
Note:

2 <= A.length <= 20000
A.length % 2 == 0
0 <= A[i] <= 1000
{%endraw%}

## Solution

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> sortArrayByParityII(vector<int>& A) {
        int ptr_even = 0, ptr_odd = 1;
        while (ptr_odd < A.size() && ptr_even < A.size()){
            while (ptr_even < A.size() //remember to put in front!!!!
                   && A[ptr_even] % 2 == 0) {
                ptr_even += 2;
            }
            while (ptr_odd < A.size() //remember to put in front!!!!
                   && A[ptr_odd] % 2 == 1) {
                ptr_odd += 2;
            }
            if (ptr_even < A.size() && ptr_odd < A.size()) {
                iter_swap(A.begin()+ptr_even, A.begin()+ptr_odd);
            }
            ptr_even += 2;
            ptr_odd += 2;
        }
        return A;
    }
};
```
