# 1375. Bulb Switcher III
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/bulb-switcher-iii/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
5

**notes**   
太难了，我觉得我没有理解。

## Description
There is a room with n bulbs, numbered from 1 to n, arranged in a row from left to right. Initially, all the bulbs are turned off.

At moment k (for k from 0 to n - 1), we turn on the light[k] bulb. A bulb change color to blue only if it is on and all the previous bulbs (to the left) are turned on too.

Return the number of moments in which all turned on bulbs are blue.

 

Example 1:



Input: light = [2,1,3,5,4]
Output: 3
Explanation: All bulbs turned on, are blue at the moment 1, 2 and 4.
Example 2:

Input: light = [3,2,4,1,5]
Output: 2
Explanation: All bulbs turned on, are blue at the moment 3, and 4 (index-0).
Example 3:

Input: light = [4,1,2,3]
Output: 1
Explanation: All bulbs turned on, are blue at the moment 3 (index-0).
Bulb 4th changes to blue at the moment 3.
Example 4:

Input: light = [2,1,4,3,6,5]
Output: 3
Example 5:

Input: light = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: 6
 

Constraints:

n == light.length
1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4
light is a permutation of  [1, 2, ..., n]

## Solution
思路：

如果目前为止最右边的亮的灯 等于 目前的轮次 
e.g. 2 is the right most light, and current is round 2
BUT, in the problem, round is zero index based, light is 1 based!!! 

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int numTimesAllBlue(vector<int>& light) {
        int right = -1;
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < light.size(); i++){
            right = max(right, light[i]);
            if (i+1 == right){
                res++;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
