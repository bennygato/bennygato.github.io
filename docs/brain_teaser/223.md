# 223. Rectangle Area

[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/rectangle-area/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
4

**notes**
see [836. Rectangle Overlap](/docs/836) for more info.

## Description
Find the total area covered by two rectilinear rectangles in a 2D plane.

Each rectangle is defined by its bottom left corner and top right corner as shown in the figure.

Rectangle Area

Example:

Input: A = -3, B = 0, C = 3, D = 4, E = 0, F = -1, G = 9, H = 2
Output: 45
Note:

Assume that the total area is never beyond the maximum possible value of int.

## Solution

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int computeArea(int A, int B, int C, int D, int E, int F, int G, int H) {
        int overlap = 0;
        bool has_overlap = (A < G) && (E < C) && (B < H) && (F < D);
        if (has_overlap){
            int x = min(C, G) - max(A, E);
            int y = min(D, H) - max(B, F);
            overlap = x * y;
        }
        return ((long long) C-A)*(D-B) + ((long long)G-E)*(H-F) - overlap;
        
    }
};
```
