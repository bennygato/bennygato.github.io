# 1390. Four Divisors

[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/four-divisors/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
4

**notes**

## Description

Given an integer array nums, return the sum of divisors of the integers in that array that have exactly four divisors.

If there is no such integer in the array, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [21,4,7]
Output: 32
Explanation:
21 has 4 divisors: 1, 3, 7, 21
4 has 3 divisors: 1, 2, 4
7 has 2 divisors: 1, 7
The answer is the sum of divisors of 21 only.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10^4
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5

## Solution

```c++
/* any number has 2 devisors already: 1 and itself. 
so 4 devisor meaning other than 1 and self, the other two devisors
are a PAIR a, b that a*b = num
Also make sure no other number c can be devisible by num so that 
no c*d = num = a*b appears.
*/
class Solution {
public:
    int sumFourDivisors(vector<int>& nums) {
        int res = 0;
        for (auto num : nums){
            int last_d = 0;
            for(int d = 2; d*d <= num; d++){
                if (num%d == 0){
                    if(last_d == 0){
                        last_d = d;
                    }
                    else{ 
                        // there are more than 1 pair of devisor, 
                        //set last_d to 0 to invalidate it.
                        last_d = 0; 
                        break;
                    }
                }
            }
            if (last_d != 0 && last_d*last_d != num){
                res += (1 + num + last_d + num/last_d);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
