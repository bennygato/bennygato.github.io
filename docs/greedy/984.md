# 984. String Without AAA or BBB

[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-without-aaa-or-bbb/)

**difficulty(1-5)**
4

**notes**   

## Description

Given two integers A and B, return any string S such that:

S has length A + B and contains exactly A 'a' letters, and exactly B 'b' letters;
The substring 'aaa' does not occur in S;
The substring 'bbb' does not occur in S.
 

Example 1:

Input: A = 1, B = 2
Output: "abb"
Explanation: "abb", "bab" and "bba" are all correct answers.
Example 2:

Input: A = 4, B = 1
Output: "aabaa"
 

Note:

0 <= A <= 100
0 <= B <= 100
It is guaranteed such an S exists for the given A and B.

## Solution

cnt1 is the count that appears more, cnt2 is the fewer one.

let's say `first` is the char representing cnt1, `second` represents cnt2.

always put the `first` to res, reduce cnt1. If cnt1 is still larger than cnt2, put another `first`, otherwise put a `second`.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    string strWithout3a3b(int A, int B) {
        char first = (A >= B) ? 'a' : 'b';
        char second = (A >= B) ? 'b' : 'a';
        int cnt1 = max(A,B); // cnt for first
        int cnt2 = min(A,B); // cnt for second
        string res;
        while(cnt1){
            res += first;
            cnt1--;
            if (cnt1 > cnt2){
                res += first;
                cnt1--;
            }
            if(cnt2){
                res += second;
                cnt2--;
            }
        }
        
        return res;
    }
};
```
